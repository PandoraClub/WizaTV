msgid "FreeSurround is intended to be the Kodi equivalent of your hi-fi receiver's Dolby ProLogic II button with the exception that it uses a different algorithm.\nIts purpose is to decode surround information from your stereo music from mp3 tracks, etc., and to produce multichannel output from it. It works with any stereo music containing surround info in a coding scheme compatible with any the following decoders:\n - Dolby Surround\n - Dolby ProLogic\n - Dolby ProLogic II\n - SRS CircleSurround\n - SRS CircleSurround II\n - DTS Neo:6\n - Lexicon Logic7\n - Stereo Quadrophonic (SQ)\n - Quadrophonic Stereo (QS)\n\nIs based on the foo_dsp_fsurround which is part of the pro_optimizer found in foobar2000 0.9.x"
