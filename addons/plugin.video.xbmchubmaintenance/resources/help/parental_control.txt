HUB Parental Controls allow you to lock videos based on their MPAA rating. Enabling this function in the 
MAINTENANCE TOOL means that, depending on your settings, you will be asked for a PIN before playing a video.

MAINTENANCE TOOL will install its own parentalcontrol module. Parental Controls are only active if the addon
developer calls the module as part of their PLAY function.

[COLOR gold][B]Settings[/B][/COLOR] 

Set the following:
[COLOR cyan][Enable Parental Control][/COLOR]: Turn parental control on/off

[COLOR cyan][Set watershed time][/COLOR]: Set a time between 15:00 and 23:00 or set to "ALWAYS ON"
Any video will play without needing a PIN after this time, but controls are automatically turned 
on again at 6AM	
				  
[COLOR cyan][Set minimum watershed rating][/COLOR]: There are 4 settings (movie rating first).......
a. "G or TV-Y/TV-Y7/TV-G"
b. "PG or TV-Y7-FV/TV-PG"
c. "PG-13 or TV-14"
d. "R/NC-17 or TV-MA"
Any movie or tv show with a rating EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN your setting will require
a PIN before playing (unless it is past your watershed time) 

[COLOR cyan][Set PIN][/COLOR]: PIN is set to "0000" by default. I suggest setting a 4 digit PIN as it's easier to 
enter on a remote.

[COLOR cyan][Set action if no rating is available][/COLOR]: Sometimes a rating is not available. Set your option 
here to either play them or require a PIN.

[COLOR red]Locking the Parental Control settings[/COLOR]
If your kids know their way round the settings window you can lock them to your PIN.
In the Parental Controls menu you will see a new link to [LOCK Parental Control Settings]. 
If you enter the correct PIN the Parental Control settings tab will be locked. To unlock, perform the same action.

MPAA ratings are sourced directly from the metahandler module. 
If for some reason there is no rating available you will be given the option to set your own rating when playing the movie/tv show. You will need your PIN to save the rating and/or to play the title when no MPAA rating is available. When you set a rating it will be saved for future plays.
