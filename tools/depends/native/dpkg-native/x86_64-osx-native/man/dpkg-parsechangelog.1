.RI [ options ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION

This directory is searched before the default directories
which are currently
.BR /usr/local/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog " and "
.BR /usr/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog .

.TP
.BR \-\-version

.SS Parser Options
The following options can be used to influence the output of
the changelog parser, e.g. the range of entries or the format
of the output. They need to be supported by the parser script
in question. See also \fBCAVEATS\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-format " outputformat"
Set the output format. Currently supported values are
.IR dpkg " and " rfc822 .
\fIdpkg\fP is the classic output format (from before this
option existed) and the default. It consists of one paragraph
in Debian control format (see \fBdeb-control\fP(5)). If more
than one entry is requested, then most fields are taken from the
latest entry, except otherwise stated:
.RS
.TP
.BR Source: " <pkg name>"
.TP
.BR Version: " <version>"
.TP
.BR Distribution: " <target distribution>"
.TP
.BR Urgency: " <urgency>"
The highest urgency of all included entries is used.
.TP
.BR Maintainer: " <author>"
.TP
.BR Date: " <date>"
.TP
.BR Closes: " <bug number>"
The Closes fields of all included entries are merged.
.TP
.BR Changes: " <changelog entries>"
The text of all changelog entries is concatenated. To make
this field a valid Debian control format multiline field
empty lines are replaced with a single full stop and all lines
is intended by one space character. The exact content depends
on the changelog format.
.RE
.IP
There might be additional user-defined fields present.
.IP
The \fBrfc822\fP format uses the same fields but outputs
a separate paragraph for each changelog entry so that all
metadata for each entry is preserved.
.TP

include all changes later than \fIversion\fP.
.TP
.BR \-\-until ", " \-u " \fIversion\fP"
include all changes earlier than \fIversion\fP.
.TP
.BR \-\-from ", " \-f " \fIversion\fP"
include all changes equal or later than \fIversion\fP.
.TP
.BR \-\-to ", " \-t " \fIversion\fP"
include all changes up to or equal than \fIversion\fP.
.TP
.BR \-\-count ", " \-c ", " \-n " \fInumber\fI"

if \fInumber\fP is lower than 0).
.TP
.BR \-\-offset ", " \-o " \fInumber\fP"
change the starting point for \-\-count, counted from the top
(or the tail if \fInumber\fP is lower than 0).
.TP
.B \-\-all
include all changes.
.
.SH CAVEATS

\fBdpkg\fP, version 1.14.16 and later. Third party parsers for
changelog formats other than \fIdebian\fP might not support
all options.
