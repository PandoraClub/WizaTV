00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,399
Citizens of Colombia,

3
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:29,821
we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

4
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,622
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

5
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,208
Thank you.

6
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,128
How are you, sir?

7
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,428
Thank you.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,349
Thank you.

9
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,271
Much appreciated.

10
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,903
Thank you.

11
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,405
Please come in, Mr. President.

12
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,346
Mmm.

13
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,349
- All yours.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,359
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

15
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,862
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- What's this?

16
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,158
♪ Happy birthday, dear Pablo ♪

17
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,662
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

18
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,040
Bravo, Pablito.

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,544
I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.

20
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,380
Don't forget to blow out the candles, Dad.

21
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,884
Happy birthday, Daddy!

22
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,720
Pablo, we miss you so much.

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,889
We wish we could be there with you.

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,641
I know, my love.

25
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,687
Soon this will all be behind us.

26
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,356
I promise.

27
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,877
Look up "magical realism"
in the dictionary,

28
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,588
and it'll describe a literary style

29
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,757
incorporating fantastic
or mythical elements

30
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,051
into otherwise realistic fiction.

31
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,720
Colombia is where it began.

32
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,099
And anyone who's spent real time here
knows why.

33
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,394
It's a place where the bizarre
shakes hands with the inexplicable

34
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,520
on a daily basis.

35
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,149
But just like in the novels
of Gabriel García Márquez,

36
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,362
the weird shit usually pops off
at certain critical moments.

37
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,448
When the whole place is on edge.

38
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,869
When everything's about to change.

39
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,793
Of all the people who had
a vested interest in nailing Escobar,

40
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,629
Javier Peña deserved to be there
when it went down.

41
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,426
No American had given more or done more.

42
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,180
Well...

43
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,474
To, uh...

44
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,394
the Drug Enforcement Administration?

45
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,522
I'll drink to that while I still can.

46
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,316
You're a fucking lifer, Javi.

47
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:24,949
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out which long-term DEA agent

48
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,076
was linked to the Los Pepes death squad.

49
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Well, the Board of Professional Conduct

50
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,539
has never been accused
of being geniuses, so...

51
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,375
Yeah, and who reads
the Miami Herald anyway, right?

52
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,216
Murphy, listen.

53
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,761
I meant what I said.

54
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,932
Anyone starts asking questions, just
tell them what they want to hear, okay?

55
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,561
- It was always on me.
- Fuck you, Javi.

56
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,813
And anybody who comes around asking.

57
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,321
Well, you do me a favor. You...

58
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,825
You get him.

59
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,996
Attention passengers.

60
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,419
We will now start boarding Flight 464
to Washington, D.C. at Gate Two.

61
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,422
All right, well, I gotta...
I can't finish this. It's...

62
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,548
I gotta go.

63
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,390
Take care of yourself.

64
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,859
All it took was the whiff of a scandal

65
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,112
out of the mouth of an exiled drug queen

66
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,281
and Peña was gone, like fucking magic.

67
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,117
Good morning, boss.

68
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,828
I made some eggs.

69
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,665
- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,333
Thanks.

71
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,006
I got everything we need, boss.

72
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,342
You went to a different store, correct?

73
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,928
Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

74
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,935
So, the shopkeeper's mom, she's a healer.

75
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,772
I paid her a visit.

76
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,777
I told you not to talk to anybody.

77
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,197
Yeah, boss, but...

78
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:16,245
only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

79
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,873
Look...

80
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,461
I asked her for something to protect you.

81
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,048
The sword of St. Michael the archangel...

82
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,259
- the Virgin...
- ...and the Holy Child of Atocha.

83
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,761
Mmm-hmm.

84
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,435
You know my mother and I built a church?

85
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,896
Yes, sir.

86
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,066
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.

87
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,734
That's where I grew up, boss.

88
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,446
Happy birthday, sir.

89
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,241
Thank you, Limón.

90
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,285
Pardon me.

91
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,627
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

92
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,631
♪ Happy birthday, dear Pablo ♪

93
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,591

94
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,886
This signal is coming from Medellín.

95
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,264
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.

96
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,267
- Pablo's come home.
- I think so.

97
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,190
Hopefully he will
speak to them again tomorrow.

98
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,854
If he does, we'll be listening.

99
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,459
This stays between us, understood?

100
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:52,049
We will set up a temporary base
in Casablanca.

101
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,262
We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

102
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,222
- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

103
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,687
Lieutenant Martinez?

104
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,526
How long since we heard anything
from Escobar? A month? A month and a half?

105
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,528
A month and a half, sir.

106
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,490
And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

107
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,286
Yes. Waiting.

108
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,416
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.
It's in our blood.

109
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,837
Excuse me.

110
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,219
Six.

111
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:52,109
Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

112
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
It's your turn.

113
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,326
I think if coke was legal, boss,

114
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:05,164
you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

115
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,009
Yes, sir.

116
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,722
We're sure that the call came from
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellín.

117
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,225
This is the best intel
we've received in months.

118
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,104
Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

119
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,232
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

120
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,859
If your men are able to find Escobar...

121
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,446
I don't care about the consequences.

122
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,283
I want him dead.

123
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,912
Do you have a problem with that?

124
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:52,962
With all due respect, Mr. President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

125
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,297
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

126
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,134
Keep me informed.

127
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,972
Gentlemen.

128
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,009
Mrs. Escobar?

129
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,928
The attorney general called this morning.

130
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,723
He's decided to end
your protective custody.

131
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,894
So we have to leave by the weekend.

132
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,647
No. No, you can't do this to us.

133
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,026
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

134
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,075
Ma'am? Ma'am.

135
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,870
May I give you some advice?

136
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,461
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

137
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,087
Forget about him.

138
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,946
The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?

139
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,284
Probably not a good idea
right now, my love.

140
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,539
So... do you feel a year older or what?

141
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,834
More like four or five.

142
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

143
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,881
The days feel longer.

144
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,344
For me too.

145
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,890
I still don't understand
why you're in Medellín.

146
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,142
That place is too dangerous, my love.

147
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,692
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

148
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,152
Pablo...

149
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,825
I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

150
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,830
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

151
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,206
You can survive prison.

152
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,421
We both know that won't happen.

153
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,798
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

154
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,968
- Listen to me, Pablo.
- They're talking.

155
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,971
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

156
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,308
You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

157
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,934
My man.

158
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,438
My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

159
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,356
The people love you and follow you.

160
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,401
Tata, Limón wants me off.

161
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,654
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

162
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,742
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

163
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,455
They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

164
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,457
They gave him the Nobel Prize.

165
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,462
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

166
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,464
Of the same country that imprisoned him.

167
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,609
I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

168
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,313
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

169
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,179
All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

170
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,139
It's very important.

171
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,267
It's our only way out really.

172
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,937
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

173
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,814
Colonel!
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.

174
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,817
Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

175
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,277
I'll think about it.

176
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,488
All right?

177
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,951
I love you very much.

178
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,442
Where are you going?

179
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,319
To Medellín.

180
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,949
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

181
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,827
My son needs me.

182
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,204
How so?

183
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,289
What you want...

184
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,169
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

185
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,037
I don't want them to kill him.

186
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,288
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

187
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,925
They won't if he turns himself in.

188
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,886
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

189
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,805
No! No, ma'am.

190
00:16:54,888 --> 00:17:01,311
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

191
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,274
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

192
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,111
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

193
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,238
We can't even leave the country.

194
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,244
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

195
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,247
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

196
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,630
My son...

197
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,217
needs his mother.

198
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,060
Hermilda.

199
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,447
Please be very careful. Please.

200
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,200
Tell the children...

201
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,621
I'll tell them.

202
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,558
We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

203
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,146
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

204
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,775
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

205
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,654
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

206
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,908
Now, if he resists...

207
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,745
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

208
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,414
I want you to take his life. Understood?

209
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,250
- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

210
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,717
Everything all right, boss?

211
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,990
Tata wants me to surrender.

212
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,331
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

213
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,625
Nelson Mandela?

214
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
Who's that, boss?

215
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,308
Did you buy more rolling papers?

216
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,477
Sorry, no, boss.

217
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,265
I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

218
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,121
He's not here.

219
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,755
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

220
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,801
This is my city, Limón.

221
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,515
These are my people.

222
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,397
Medellín will never betray me.

223
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,154
Colonel.

224
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,698
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

225
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,618
Looks like your little machine is broken.

226
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,745
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

227
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,623
Excuse me, Colonel.

228
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,964
Listen up! Take down
the staging area and head back to Holguín.

229
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,187
Son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

230
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,112
- A ghost.
- What's that?

231
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,658
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

232
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,828
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

233
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,711
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

234
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,548
Give me the keys!

235
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,300
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

236
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,662
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

237
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,248
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

238
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,500
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

239
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,894
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

240
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,817
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

241
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,369
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

242
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,788
Sir.

243
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,000
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

244
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,560
- Kick it here!
- There you go.

245
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,730
Yeah!

246
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,806
You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

247
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,100
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

248
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,855
They're offering seven million dollars
for your head,

249
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,190
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

250
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,988
You look just like Che Guevara.

251
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,990
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

252
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,868
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

253
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,004
What? You don't miss me or what?

254
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,302
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

255
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,555
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

256
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,099
Thank you, Gustavo.

257
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,148
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

258
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,319
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

259
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,987
Never letting anything stop him.

260
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,575
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

261
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,413
You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

262
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,792
- Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.
- Mmm.

263
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,505
Tata wants me to surrender.

264
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,094
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

265
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,096
Maybe it's a good idea.

266
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,853
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

267
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:18,316
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

268
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,776
The legend grows.

269
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,946
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

270
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:29,077
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

271
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,790
Let's cut the bullshit.

272
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,628
We are bandits, Pablo.

273
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,463
Right?

274
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,263
What do you think?

275
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,351
I think...

276
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,983
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

277
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,906
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

278
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,377
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

279
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,711
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

280
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,506
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

281
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,178
It worked perfectly.

282
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,561
You're a good man, Limón.

283
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,857
Thank you.

284
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,860
Thanks a lot.

285
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,739
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

286
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,535
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

287
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,911
I'm hungry.

288
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,457
Tata?

289
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,545
Pablo?

290
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,298
There's the love of my life.

291
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,053
- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

292
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,597
I feel good.

293
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,519
And ready to talk to those reporters.

294
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,106
Good, my love.

295
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,275
Does that mean you're turning yourself in?

296
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,238
No, Tata.

297
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,366
I'll never surrender.

298
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,205
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

299
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,042
You have to.

300
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,423
I'll never surrender, my love.

301
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,564
I know, Pablo.

302
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,902
But what's your plan?

303
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,573
All right.

304
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,825
I know what we're going to do.

305
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,207
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

306
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,250
That's what we are going to do.

307
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,717
- ...foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

308
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,637
...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

309
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,348
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

310
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,481
We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

311
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,945
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

312
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,782
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

313
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,951
You have to believe me.

314
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,746
- We will succeed.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

315
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:30,253
As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

316
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,421
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

317
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,758
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

318
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,677
And listen...

319
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,349
I will not rest until that happens.

320
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,811
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

321
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,608
I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

322
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,323
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

323
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,867
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

324
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,285
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

325
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,037
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

326
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,333
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

327
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,670
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

328
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,130
Colonel, I found him.

329
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,132
Who? Escobar?

330
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,676
Yes, Colonel.

331
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,344
He's in Los Olivos.

332
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,934
Son, are you sure? We can't afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

333
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,229
I'm sure. I saw him.

334
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,691
What do you mean you saw him?

335
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,904
Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

336
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,823
And did he see you?

337
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,618
No, I don't think so.

338
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,455
Listen up, Lieutenant.

339
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,041
There's still some men
in the staging area.

340
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,711
I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

341
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,963
Copy that, Colonel.

342
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,966
One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

343
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,596
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

344
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,849
Hello, Dad.

345
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,768
How's it going, son?

346
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,396
You wanted to ask me something or what?

347
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,731
Yes, sir.

348
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,234
What wish did you make for your birthday?

349
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,779
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

350
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,907
Tell me! Don't be like that!

351
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,409
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

352
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,912
is that it was a very good wish.

353
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,871
You know,

354
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,415
you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

355
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,054
Thank you, my love.

356
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,766
Captain.

357
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,436
- Captain, can you hear me?
- Yes, Colonel?

358
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,897
How many men are left
in the provisional base?

359
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,775
- Counting me, about 12.
- Listen up.

360
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,780
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- Shit! Let's go!

361
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,366
Everybody to Los Olivos!

362
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,076
Hello.

363
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:11,539
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

364
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,622
Good.

365
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,460
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

366
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,556
Perez!

367
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,393
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

368
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,769
This is the house.

369
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,065
Get your mom on the phone, okay?

370
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,192
Pablo.

371
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,796
- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

372
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,740
The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

373
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,369
"How do you feel after
all these days on the run?"

374
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,664
Write this down.

375
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,044
"It's been very hard
being far from my family,

376
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,047
who I love more than anything
in the world."

377
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,550
- Sergeant, go around.
- "But I feel good.

378
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,177
I feel strong.

379
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,057
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

380
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,770
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

381
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:22,860
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

382
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,656
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

383
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,955
The government
is holding my family hostage.

384
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,377
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

385
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,588
that calls itself democratic.

386
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,175
My little kids are innocent children

387
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:50,721
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

388
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,480
All we want from the government

389
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,483
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

390
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:08,697
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

391
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,950
Without that..."

392
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,496
One moment.

393
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,373
What happened, Pablo?

394
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,296
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

395
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,924
Pablo. Pablo.

396
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,136
Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.

397
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,179
Pablo, what's going on?

398
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,516
What's wrong, Mom?

399
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,063
Go on. All right.

400
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,323
Go! Go!

401
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,742
Let's go!

402
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,166
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

403
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,333
Come on!

404
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,335
Come on! Move, move, move!

405
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,262
Go, go, go!

406
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,855
Move!

407
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,482
Go!

408
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,358
Keep going!

409
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,480
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

410
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,465
Sergeant Sarmiento!

411
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,343
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

412
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,220
Is he alive?

413
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,264
All that time hunting him...

414
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,893
and just like that,
I'm looking down at Pablo fucking Escobar.

415
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,523
For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.

416
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,859
What a monster he'd be.

417
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,237
But here's the thing.

418
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,116
When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.

419
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,243
Just a man.

420
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,995
Beard grows if he doesn't shave.

421
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,831
Fat and shoeless.

422
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,792
You take a good long look at evil,
and it reminds you of one...

423
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,846
Long live Colombia.

424
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,432
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

425
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,475
We killed Pablo Escobar!

426
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,395
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

427
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,815
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live Colombia!

428
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,048
Go ahead.

429
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,600
They killed Pablo Escobar!

430
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,022
My son! My son...

431
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,380
I pray to God that other mothers

432
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,551
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

433
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,513
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

434
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,641
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

435
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,851
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

436
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,229
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

437
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,482
He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.

438
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,526
No one has paid attention to that.

439
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,738
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

440
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:08,450
He was the noblest
of men. Not just as a son...

441
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,440
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

442
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,900
Thank you.

443
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,908
Talk to me.

444
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,497
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

445
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,625
He told you that?

446
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,090
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

447
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,217
you were once associates and friends.

448
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,226
You were saying?

449
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:22,441
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

450
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,069
That you would forgive us.

451
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,073
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

452
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,746
How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?

453
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,415
In property? In cash?

454
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,463
I can find out.

455
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,635
That's good.

456
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,346
Because I want all of it.

457
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,886
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

458
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,265
You're the review board, right?

459
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,062
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

460
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,108
We're not the review board.

461
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,029
So who are you?

462
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,242
We're from Operations.

463
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,540
What do you want from me?

464
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,960
All right, gentlemen!

465
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,628
Gentlemen!

466
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:12,759
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

467
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,720
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

468
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,013
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

469
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,684
311 metric tons.

470
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,981
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

471
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,985
And when your rival no longer exists.

472
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:38,034
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

473
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,579
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

474
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,664
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

475
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,083
And cocaine production goes up.

476
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,253
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

477
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,672
but how well one has prepared for them.

478
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:55,093
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

479
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,846
Can you imagine what happens next year?

480
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,976
And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

481
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,354
We will do it covertly.

482
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,232
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

483
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,650
we'll no longer be there.

484
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,486
No, sir!

485
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,905
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

486
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,617
Now the king is dead. Long live the kings.

487
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,709
Agent Peña, how much do you know
about the Cali cartel?

487
00:51:28,305 --> 00:51:34,913
