1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,885
When you find that one person
who connects you to the world...

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,514
...you become someone different.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,934
Someone better.

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,939
When that person is taken from you...

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,902
...what do you become then?

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,245
Whatever you wanna do, you know? Unh.

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,706
What? Hmm?

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,919
What, where did you get that, in a cereal
box? Huh? You wanna see a real gun?

9
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,505
Forget you.

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,426
Every punk is carrying. That's why your
father wanted us to take the car home.

11
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,553
Relax.

12
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,432
Picking up new hardware next week.
Restore a little order.

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,936
Besides, when we take the car,
we don't get to meet new friends.

14
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,271
Like this guy.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,074
In order to continue OpenSubtitles.org
subtitles service you need to Log In

16
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,621
You bring enough
for the whole group?

17
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,249
Time to teach you about sharing.

18
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,500
I'll need a statement from the bum.
Which hospital did they take him to?

19
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,878
Declined treatment.
We got video on it though.

20
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,983
You know,
you could've done me a favor...

21
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,194
...and let those guys
land a couple more punches.

22
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,446
Question for you.

23
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,034
Looking at that tape, I'd say
you spent some time in the service.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,704
I did.

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,747
Army.

26
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,041
Two tours in Iraq.

27
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,503
But you don't learn how to fight like that
in the regular army.

28
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,674
So, what were you?
Special Forces? Delta?

29
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,513
I'm Carter. You didn't give us a name.

30
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,476
You know, it's funny.
Best parts of your life...

31
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,021
...you don't need a name.

32
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,608
You get to be "Dad,"
"sweetheart," "pal. "

33
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,279
Seems like the only time you need
a name now is when you're in trouble.

34
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,865
So am I in trouble?

35
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,576
I don't know. You tell me.

36
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,661
You're the one living on the street.

37
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,251
You're not from here, are you?
What, you're just passing through?

38
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,047
I came to find an old friend.

39
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,636
Yeah, making that transition back
can be tough.

40
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,764
Some guys I knew got a little lost.

41
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,684
That disconnect between
what they were trained to do...

42
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,896
...and what they were expected to do
when they got home.

43
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,441
Some of them just
needed a little help adjusting.

44
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,905
You need some help?

45
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,913
Of course, some other guys I knew...

46
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,208
...they had done so many evil things...

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,753
...they felt
like they needed the punishment.

48
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,508
That sound more like your story, "pal"?

49
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,264
Excuse me for a second.

50
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,865
I'm here for my client.

51
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,911
Wow. Wow, wow.

52
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,581
Your guy's prints were found in half
a dozen crime scenes over the years.

53
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
Open warrants
in four different countries.

54
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,713
Missing Persons here in Queens,
'07, three guys disappeared.

55
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,591
Who you got down there, Carter?
The angel of death?

56
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,304
I appreciate the help, counselor.

57
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,182
But who's picking up the tab?

58
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,396
Our employer
wants to have a word with you.

59
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,272
Do I owe you money?

60
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,401
Because I'm, uh, running a little short
at the moment.

61
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,529
You don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese.

62
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,491
That's the name you prefer, isn't it?

63
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,951
I know you've had several.

64
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,581
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell anybody about you.

65
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,585
You don't know anything about me.

66
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,464
I know exactly everything about you,
Mr. Reese.

67
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,842
I know about the work you used to do
for the government.

68
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,096
I know about the doubts
you came to have about that work.

69
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,016
I know that the government, along
with everybody else, thinks you're dead.

70
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,064
I know you've spent the last couple of
months trying to drink yourself to death.

71
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,944
I know you're contemplating
more efficient ways to do it.

72
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,279
Which would be a shame.

73
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,700
So you see,
knowledge is not my problem.

74
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,204
Doing something
with that knowledge...

75
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,249
...that's where you'd come in.

76
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,751
Who sent you?

77
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,003
Nobody sent me.

78
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,589
You can call me Mr. Finch.

79
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,719
I think you and I
can help one another.

80
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,641
I don't think you need a psychiatrist
or a support group or pills.

81
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,269
What do I need?

82
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,771
You need a purpose.

83
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,151
More specifically, you need a job.

84
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,617
Eight million people.

85
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,454
You know what they all have
in common?

86
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,791
None of them knows
what happens next.

87
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,585
Good things, maybe.

88
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,420
But for some of them, not so good.

89
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,092
Someone is murdered in New York City
every 18 hours. It's like Musical Chairs.

90
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,012
At the end of the day,
one of these people will be gone.

91
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,474
Bad things happen to people
every day.

92
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,102
- You can't stop that.
- What if you could?

93
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,521
Not things that happen
in the heat of the moment.

94
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:07,486
But so many crimes are planned
days, weeks in advance.

95
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,614
What if you could stop those?

96
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,449
Let me guess...

97
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,075
...you're a psychic.

98
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,662
Ha, ha. No psychic, no magic.
None of that.

99
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,289
It's funny, when I was a kid...

100
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,752
...I wanted a jet pack,
I wanted a summer house on Mars.

101
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,005
Then I realized I was living in
the Information Age.

102
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,633
This was a shocking disappointment
to me...

103
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,053
...until I realized
how revolutionary it was.

104
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:38,350
All of us are leaving a trail
of information in our wake.

105
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,977
Most of it's useless.

106
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,397
There's something hidden
in all that mess.

107
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,359
A faint outline of things to come.

108
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,488
The right person in the right place
with the right information...

109
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,115
...could change everything.

110
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,160
This is the problem I have, Mr. Reese...

111
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,454
...I've got a list.

112
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,667
A list of people who are about
to be involved in very bad situations.

113
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,877
Murders, kidnappings.

114
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,881
- Where did you get this list?
- Can't tell you, you'll have to trust me.

115
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,636
The people that are on my list, they have
no idea that anything's about to happen.

116
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,764
Most of them are just ordinary people.

117
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,350
Like who?

118
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,186
- Like her.
- Thank you.

119
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,315
Her name is Diane Hansen.

120
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,110
And this week,
she's at the top of my list.

121
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,696
Think something bad
is gonna happen involving her?

122
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,155
It's not that simple.

123
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,993
I don't know exactly what's gonna
happen or what her role in it is.

124
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,496
She might be the victim.
She could be the perpetrator.

125
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,915
All I know is that she is involved.

126
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,335
I want you to follow her.
Figure out what's gonna happen.

127
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,087
And stop it from happening.

128
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,672
Why not call the police?

129
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,926
If anybody knew I had this list,
it would be...

130
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,053
...problematic.

131
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,850
You would name your own salary,
expenses, whatever you need.

132
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,019
So, what do you think?

133
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,983
I think you're a bored rich guy.

134
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,820
I think that woman's your ex-wife
or someone you rode in an elevator with.

135
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,905
Either way, I think I'm done.

136
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,303
Police are looking for
a homeless man for further questioning.

137
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,680
The unidentified man
was originally believed...

138
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,642
...to be the victim
of a violent assault on a subway.

139
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,478
But now police consider the man
a person of interest...

140
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,522
...in a number of crimes nationwide.

141
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,166
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?

142
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,835
Jessica, what's wrong?

143
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,938
You need to understand, Mr. Reese.

144
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,982
The information I have is incomplete.
But it's never wrong.

145
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,694
You need to know
what it would be like to be forced...

146
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,030
...to listen to someone get murdered
and not be able to do anything about it.

147
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
Shut up!

148
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,918
Rick, no!

149
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,185
Kill 138.7, X-ray.

150
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,606
Twelve, August, 2008, 1:37 a.m.

151
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,735
Too late.

152
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,571
This recording is three years old.

153
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,742
A woman murdered in this room
by her husband.

154
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,619
For the insurance.

155
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,164
You were too late for her.

156
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,250
Just like you were too late
for your friend Jessica.

157
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,962
You were halfway around the world
when she was killed.

158
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,257
- What the hell do you know about it?
- It's the truth.

159
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,177
You left the government
because they lied. I never will.

160
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,263
A man with your skills
could make a lot of money...

161
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,432
...in this world but you don't do it.

162
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,977
I think all you ever wanted to do
is protect people.

163
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,408
That's a wiretap recording.

164
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,412
NSA or FISA. Government.

165
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,919
- But you're not government.
- No, I'm not.

166
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,722
I guess you could call me
a concerned third party.

167
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,726
You couldn't have saved this woman.

168
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,603
Or your friend.

169
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,397
But you could have
if you had known in time.

170
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,527
That's the other thing I'm offering you.
A chance to be there in time.

171
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,784
It's not too late for her.

172
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,203
You could help me stop
what's about to happen.

173
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,413
The question is, will you?

174
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,022
Diane Hansen.

175
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,025
Grew up in Detroit.

176
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,361
Moved to the city after law school.

177
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,488
Single.

178
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,367
- Does she have any enemies?
One or two.

179
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,578
She's an assistant district attorney.

180
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,872
The best conviction record
in her department.

181
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,084
Great. Nice short list
of possible suspects.

182
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,421
We have no idea when this bad thing
might happen, huh?

183
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,965
Could be in a week,
could be five minutes.

184
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,510
That's why we need to learn
as much as we can about her.

185
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,723
- How do you intend to begin?
- The slow way.

186
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,099
Cultivate a relationship.

187
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,688
Engineering situations
over weeks, months...

188
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,107
...to allow you to earn the asset's trust.

189
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,984
And the fast way?

190
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,073
Break into her home
and go through all her stuff.

191
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,834
What is this place?

192
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,004
The decline of Western civilization.

193
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,632
The city closed half its libraries.

194
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,008
Budget cuts.

195
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,888
This building was sold
to a bank that I control...

196
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,349
...which promptly
declared bankruptcy.

197
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:23,106
So the property is in a kind of limbo.
It doesn't exist.

198
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,484
Neither do you.
I did a little digging.

199
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,487
I recognize, Mr. Reese,
that there is a disparity...

200
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,783
...between how much I know about you
and how much you know about me.

201
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,120
I know you'll be trying to close that gap
as quickly as possible.

202
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,208
But I should tell you
I'm a really private person.

203
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,338
What have you found out about
our Ms. Hansen?

204
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,840
Well, she's squeaky-clean.

205
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,134
No debts, no attachments.

206
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,179
But she is taking ulcer medication,
sleeping pills...

207
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,932
...so she's scared or stressed
about something.

208
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,019
Assuming she's the target,
I'm going through her work e-mails...

209
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,230
...case files, looking for
anyone who stands out.

210
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,067
I've got picture on her.

211
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,696
But I need sound.

212
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,281
I could hack her cell phone...

213
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,534
...use the microphone to listen in,
GPS to track her.

214
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,162
But that takes gear
that's a little hard to come by.

215
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,497
Thought you might need that.

216
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,667
- So I built one.
- Oh.

217
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,426
"Good with computers. "

218
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,268
Driver's licenses.

219
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,856
Credit cards. Six cover identities.

220
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,109
Funds to be replenished
through a proxy corporation.

221
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,738
Just like when you were
with the agency.

222
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,324
When I was with the agency...

223
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,952
...I knew who was picking up the tab.

224
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,246
This is your list?

225
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,457
- The list?
- Yup.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,460
But you don't get names, do you?

227
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,589
These are Social Security numbers...

228
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,718
...and each of them map out
to a violent crime.

229
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,431
- And all of these numbers represent...
- Lost chances.

230
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,310
I could be more help if you'd tell me
where you're getting these numbers.

231
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,232
It doesn't matter where. What you need
to know is that the next number is hers.

232
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,359
Trust works both ways, Finch.

233
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:35,071
If telling me where you're getting these
numbers would put your life at risk...

234
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,657
It would put a lot more people
than just me at risk.

235
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,785
And I'd say trusting an alcoholic
ex-government hitman...

236
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,163
...is a greater challenge
than trusting a middle-aged cripple.

237
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,167
I have one more address
for you to check out tonight.

238
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,173
Okay, Mr. Finch.

239
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,301
- What am I doing here?
Sleeping.

240
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,053
You have plenty to do tomorrow.

241
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,222
What are you talking about?

242
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,850
Who lives here?

243
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,561
You do, Mr. Reese.

244
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,492
Any luck finding Paul Bunyan?

245
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,370
Turns out "bearded loner"
covers a high percentage...

246
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,915
...of the homeless population.

247
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,667
Oh, thanks.

248
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,338
Wait, is this
the Missing Persons file from '07?

249
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,215
Yes, ma'am.
- This is all they had?

250
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,633
Yep.

251
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,023
Given Hansen's job,
we've got hundreds of people...

252
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,816
...who could be holding a grudge...

253
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:41,113
...so I'm starting with the people she's
worried about. I cut the list to three.

254
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,909
The first is Lawrence Pope,
the man Hansen is currently prosecuting.

255
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,246
When we got there,
the scene was, uh, colorful.

256
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,747
Five dead.

257
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,292
One of them had managed to crawl
10 feet to a phone to dial 911...

258
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,088
...despite the fact that this drug-slinging
piece of trash shot him in the gut.

259
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,966
- Your Honor.
- Pardon me, Your Honor.

260
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,885
Despite the fact that this
drug-slinging piece of trash...

261
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,012
...allegedly shot him in the gut.

262
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,390
The person who made that call
was Germaine Salts.

263
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,726
- And he was friends with the defendant?
Yeah, they were all friends.

264
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,145
We figure that's how Pope knew
the deal was going down.

265
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,898
Turns out career criminals
don't make trustworthy friends.

266
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,567
Detective Fusco,
when you interviewed Mr. Pope...

267
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,361
...what did he tell you in his defense?

268
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,488
He said if he'd shot the poor bastard...

269
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:27,618
...he would've shot him in the head,
quote, "Same as I always do," unquote.

270
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,455
Said he wouldn't have left him there
half dead, blubbering for his girlfriend.

271
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,670
No more questions, Your Honor.

272
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,056
Detective...

273
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,517
...you went a little off script
in your testimony.

274
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,103
You never told me
about that conversation...

275
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,230
...and it could clear Pope's name.

276
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,774
What's it matter, we got the guy.

277
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,277
It matters because
it's my job to make sure...

278
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,280
...the wrong people don't go to jail.
Remember?

279
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,657
Excuse me, I thought
we were on the same team.

280
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,164
You got time to talk?
I could buy you dinner?

281
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,666
- Busy. Another time?
- Is something wrong?

282
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,878
- I've been noticing lately...
No, I'm fine. Thank you. Thanks.

283
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,966
The second person I'm looking
into is Wheeler, her co-counselor.

284
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,927
Another ADA? Why?

285
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,555
Well, they dated
for a few months last year.

286
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,058
She broke things off,
and 40% of murders...

287
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,310
...involve some kind of
romantic relationship.

288
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,482
Also, Wheeler's divorced, one kid,
alimony, upside-down on his condo...

289
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,110
...career's stalled.
I asked. I can't get the time off.

290
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,529
Yeah, it is. It is a tough job.

291
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,908
But I can look out for myself,
you know that.

292
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,954
Listen, Mom, I... I know you haven't
been cashing the checks.

293
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,582
It's not charity, I'm your daughter.

294
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,584
I know. I know you worry about me.

295
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,837
I... I'm fine.

296
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,964
There's a third person
you're looking into?

297
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,551
Ex-convict named Charles Robinson.

298
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,389
Hansen and Wheeler prosecuted him
three years back, armed robbery.

299
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,392
Robinson wrote them love letters
from prison.

300
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,937
He's the first one
I'm gonna be looking into.

301
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:22,817
Robinson was released two months ago.
Hansen pulled his file last week.

302
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,466
Don't move.

303
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,385
I don't have much...

304
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,346
...but you're welcome to take
whatever you need.

305
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,142
I've been where you've been.

306
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,648
I don't think Robinson is our man.

307
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,277
He burned through a box of highlighters
on his King James Bible...

308
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,362
...none of it Old Testament.

309
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,074
- None of it Revelations.
- Fine. One down.

310
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,499
Hansen's on the move.

311
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,462
She's phoning county lockup,
arranging a meeting with Pope.

312
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,672
Alone.

313
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,799
Isn't my lawyer supposed
to be here?

314
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,179
I can call him, but the reason I'm here is
I don't think you murdered those people.

315
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,475
I think somebody else was in the house
when that 911 call was made.

316
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:41,395
Somebody who told you what was said,
which means you weren't there.

317
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,355
Is it somebody
you're trying to protect?

318
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,691
You're gonna help me? Is that it?

319
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,985
Where you from, Ohio?

320
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,446
I met DA's before,
you do a couple years of this...

321
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,199
...then try for a high-dollar job
at a law firm.

322
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,326
What happened, you get left behind?

323
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,828
I know a guy that'd put you to work
out on a corner.

324
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,330
Oh.

325
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,207
Close.

326
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,919
I grew up in Michigan. Brightmoor.
You know where that is?

327
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,922
I don't think you would've lasted
very long there, Lawrence.

328
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,674
I know what it's like
to want to get out of a place...

329
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,052
...so bad you'd be willing
to do almost anything.

330
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,180
And that's why I know, if you're gonna
take the fall for this...

331
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,890
...you must be very scared. Now...

332
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,227
...the person who knows what happened
must be somebody you care about.

333
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,604
Is it your younger brother Michael?

334
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,357
Pope's got a brother.
It's in his case file.

335
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,984
- Got it.
- Did he see the real killers?

336
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,112
You should leave this alone, lady.
I can do the time.

337
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,909
Figure I'll make amends for all the things
you never caught me on. Because I'm bad.

338
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,828
These people, they're evil.
Kill anyone they want.

339
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,499
They're protected. Keep asking,
they'll kill me and my brother.

340
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,752
- And probably you too.
- You can trust me.

341
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,755
We'll take care of you
and your brother.

342
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,887
If the killers are out there, I'm gonna
find them. It's my job. Now, why don't...?

343
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,100
Bitch, you keep your damn mouth shut
or I'll shut it for you.

344
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,190
I'm fine.

345
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,858
Okay. She's okay. She's okay.

346
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,069
Finch? You were right about Hansen.

347
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,404
Whoever framed Pope...

348
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:18,075
...will be coming after her, and only
Pope's brother knows who they are.

349
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,920
Hi, Mom. It's Jessica.

350
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,674
I'm just down in Mexico with Cindy,
and I'll be back tomorrow.

351
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,426
Okay? Talk soon. Bye.

352
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,553
Cindy?
- Yeah.

353
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,805
I look like a Cindy?
- Yeah.

354
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,808
I didn't tell her about us yet.

355
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,186
It's been six months.

356
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,397
You haven't told your mom
you left your ex?

357
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,276
Maybe you're starting to think
you got a bum deal...

358
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,820
...trading an officer for an enlisted man.

359
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,949
I wish this weekend
could go on forever.

360
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,203
Already has.

361
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,497
It's Tuesday.

362
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,791
Which means you have to go back
to the base...

363
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,128
...and I'm not gonna see you again
for two weeks, which I hate.

364
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,297
Then ask me to stay.

365
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,965
I will.

366
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,927
I'll quit.

367
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,930
- I'll quit.
- Okay, then quit.

368
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,558
I already did.

369
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,102
- What?
- Yeah.

370
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,357
I didn't wanna take the chance...

371
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,860
...that you wouldn't be here
when I got back.

372
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,823
I've been training my whole life for
something that's never gonna happen.

373
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,370
Everybody's too damn rich
to go to war.

374
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,165
I'm obsolete and I love it.

375
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,376
Because it means I get to be with you.

376
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,629
I get my discharge in a month.

377
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,049
Then I'm gonna buy a boat.

378
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,886
And you get to be my first mate.

379
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,892
But first we need some more tequila.

380
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,572
Sweetheart, what's wrong? Jessica.

381
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,408
What's wrong?

382
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,244
Uh, it's New York. I don't know.
I don't know.

383
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,496
Something happened this morning.

384
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,210
- Is it a plane crash?
- I think it's two. I think it's two planes.

385
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,307
Thanks.

386
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,936
- You went to see Pope last night?
Yeah.

387
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,231
I gave him one more chance
to turn in his accomplice. Cut a deal.

388
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,775
- He give you anything?
No, as usual.

389
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,696
I'm, uh... I'm late.

390
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,491
She's trying to track down
Pope's brother.

391
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,785
He can ID the real killers.

392
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,288
And she's stonewalling Wheeler.

393
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,623
What, does she think he's involved?

394
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,586
Remember Pope said
they were protected from on high.

395
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,299
Wait a second.

396
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,971
Turns out there's a good reason
she doesn't trust Wheeler.

397
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:31,185
He might be working with the killers,
and they're after Michael Pope.

398
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,855
We better get to this kid
before someone else does.

399
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,330
Michael?

400
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,665
Can I talk to you for a second?

401
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,893
- I got a message from your brother.
- You don't know him.

402
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,313
Not exactly. I know what you saw.
I'm not the only one looking for you.

403
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,773
You need to come with me.

404
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,694
Hey. Hey. Help me.

405
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,948
Hey, this man is trying
to put me into a taxicab with him.

406
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,158
He's trying to take pictures of me.

407
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,703
- What's going on?
- How you doing?

408
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,499
- Michael Pope's still on the subway.
- Yeah.

409
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,086
When he comes up for air you can use
the GPS on your phone to find him.

410
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:43,674
If Pope's right about these guys,
I'm gonna need more than a cell phone.

411
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,093
About that,
I don't like firearms very much.

412
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,554
Neither do I.
But if someone has to have them...

413
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:52,724
...I'd rather it was me. Besides, my friend
from the subway has a line on some.

414
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,187
Lightly used. Steep discount.

415
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,817
Let's roll, let's roll
Let's rock, let's rock

416
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,318
Rock, roll
Rock, roll

417
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,695
Hit the block
Hit the block

418
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,364
Let's roll, let's roll
Let's rock, let's rock

419
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,579
- Uh, what about this one?
- Are you planning on buying that one?

420
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,123
- I'm just...
- Put it back on the table...

421
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,917
...before somebody else
kicks your ass.

422
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,753
Have you guys seen the men's room?

423
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,382
Hey, Anton. Good to see you again.

424
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,593
You know this guy?

425
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,054
Wow, that's some pretty serious
equipment.

426
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,224
Have you guys taken a safety course?

427
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,228
Take you, for instance.
You're holding that thing sideways.

428
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:43,233
You can't aim it, and two, it'll eject
a shell casing right into your face. See?

429
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,172
I'm gonna hold on to these
while you guys get some more practice.

430
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,133
Have a nice day.

431
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,637
Who the hell was that?

432
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,810
All right, you're in.

433
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,484
Wheeler's got a secret file
on Hansen, Finch.

434
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,278
Old cases they worked together.

435
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,615
Sounds interesting. Pictures please.

436
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,702
Wait, wait, someone's coming.

437
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,169
It's Hansen.

438
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,636
Okay, now. You can go. Go, go, go.

439
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,235
Reese? I got a signal from your phone.

440
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,988
Tell me you found Michael Pope.

441
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,281
He's the only one
who knows who's after Hansen.

442
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,160
I found him, but somebody else
found him first. Listen.

443
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,833
Oh, Mikey. You were gonna tell him
all about us, weren't you? Hmm?

444
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,960
- Head uptown.
- Are you hearing this?

445
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,799
97th and Riverside. Step on it.

446
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,510
Gonna put a couple
in the back of his head.

447
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,762
Make it look like a gang thing.

448
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,515
You gotta do something.

449
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,559
Relax.

450
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,895
I'm on it.

451
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,981
Keep the change.

452
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,899
You're crazy. We're both dead now.

453
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,110
- Do you know who they are?
- I do now.

454
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,614
They're cops. Come on.

455
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,140
What exactly have you gotten me into?

456
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,643
I don't know. That's the whole point.

457
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,646
I hired you to help me figure that out.

458
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,108
Here.

459
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,152
I think we're up against
a group of corrupt cops.

460
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:18,782
I think their next target is Hansen.
But I don't know for certain.

461
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,283
I don't know anything...

462
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,662
...because you won't tell me where
you're getting your information.

463
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,670
When the towers came down,
you were in a hotel in Mexico.

464
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,923
I was here.

465
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,716
I was working.

466
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,302
Didn't know about the attacks
until that evening.

467
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,932
You see, Mr. Reese, until that day,
I had spent the better part of my life...

468
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,642
...making myself very rich.

469
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,938
Suddenly all that money
didn't seem to amount to much.

470
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,440
Do you have a phone?

471
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,526
Could you turn it off?

472
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,237
Let's walk.

473
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,991
Then I got a telephone call
from an old friend at the Pentagon.

474
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,035
After the attacks
the government gave itself the power...

475
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,665
...to read every e-mail,
listen to every cell phone.

476
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,626
But they needed something
that could sort through it all.

477
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,921
Something that could pick the terrorists
out of the population...

478
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,548
...before they could act.

479
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,924
They tried.

480
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,969
Able Danger, SpiNNaker, TIA.

481
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,512
But they were all failures.

482
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,849
Well, their biggest failure was bad PR.

483
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,852
The public wanted to be protected.

484
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,396
They just didn't wanna know
how they were.

485
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:36,401
So when they finally got a system
that worked, they kept it secret.

486
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,322
So how do you know about it?

487
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,991
I built it.

488
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,913
"Good with computers. " Remember?

489
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,378
But there was a problem
with this machine.

490
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,548
I had built it to prevent the next 9/11.

491
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,802
But it was seeing all sorts of crimes.

492
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:07,807
So I had to teach the machine
to divide the things it saw into two lists:

493
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,478
Relevant and irrelevant.

494
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,981
Events that would cause
massive loss of life were relevant.

495
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,985
So those would be passed along
to the NSA or the FBI.

496
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,321
And the irrelevant information?

497
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:28,161
Every night, at midnight,
the machine erases it.

498
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,123
It was only later
that I realized my mistake.

499
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:38,880
The whole point of Pandora's Box,
once you open it, you can't close it.

500
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,884
The idea of that irrelevant list...

501
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,637
...was eating away at me.

502
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,516
All those people with no idea
what was coming for them.

503
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,227
So where is the machine now?

504
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,187
What, the drives? Who knows?

505
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,023
A government facility somewhere.

506
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,483
But the machine?

507
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,071
The machine is everywhere.

508
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,492
Watching us with 10,000 eyes.

509
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,829
Listening with a million ears.

510
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,164
What did I tell you
about sending e-mails?

511
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,000
You could move in.

512
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,585
Never put anything in an e-mail
you cannot own.

513
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,130
You gave yourself a way
to communicate with it?

514
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:24,134
I was building the government
a tool of unimaginable power.

515
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,721
I thought maybe an off switch
would come in handy.

516
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:32,475
- So I built myself a backdoor into it.
- To access the irrelevant list.

517
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,854
Just a Social Security number.

518
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,482
If anyone ever found out,
I'd lose access. So nine digits.

519
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,734
That's all we get.

520
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,653
And we have no idea
why it picked Diane Hansen?

521
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,657
It wouldn't be steering us toward her
if it wasn't seeing something.

522
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,826
I don't know if I can protect Hansen.

523
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,828
I can't see the whole picture.

524
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,501
I offered you a job, Mr. Reese.

525
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,171
Never said it would be easy.

526
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,844
Hey, Carter.
- Yeah.

527
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,680
You hear about your pal Anton?
- No.

528
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,309
Him and his father tried to buy guns,
wound up getting shot.

529
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,186
- Are they dead?
Nope. Embarrassed.

530
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,898
They got taken out by one guy.
In a suit.

531
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,794
We've got all the parts.

532
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,505
Question is,
how do they all fit together?

533
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,176
Stills is narcotics.
Him and his men get word of deals.

534
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,429
They steal the drugs, the cash,
and kill all the witnesses.

535
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,682
Then they get Fusco to frame up guys
like Lawrence Pope for murder.

536
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,101
Exactly.

537
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,812
They've already killed five people.

538
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,231
- Six.
- What?

539
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,692
Lawrence Pope was stabbed to death
last night in his cell.

540
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,153
They're trying to cover their tracks.

541
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,907
They couldn't pull this off without
someone on the inside at the DA's office.

542
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:15,620
That's Wheeler. He's been spying on
Hansen and pulling their old case files.

543
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,705
Including the one for Robinson.

544
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,376
The same Robinson that sent Wheeler
and Hansen death threats from prison.

545
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,004
They looking for someone
they can frame like they framed Pope?

546
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,966
No, I think they found him.
But what do we do?

547
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,177
We stop them.

548
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,228
You wanted to meet?

549
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,190
Remsen and Avenue D
in Canarsie, 20 minutes.

550
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,278
Finch, it's happening now.

551
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,165
Hello?

552
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,006
Are you here?

553
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:16,014
Hello?

554
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,816
You're gonna keep me waiting?
We don't have time.

555
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,777
What's your problem? Pope is dead.

556
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,531
His brother is gone, and we're still
searching for the clown who took him.

557
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,494
The problem is Wheeler, you idiot.
He knows.

558
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,163
He knows about Pope
and maybe some of the others.

559
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,082
We should have taken care of
this guy weeks ago.

560
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,460
I even found a shooter for you.

561
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,129
- Stop dragging your feet on this.
- How long do we have?

562
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,716
Twenty-four to 48 hours
before he goes to the DA, tops.

563
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,303
I can take care of the files at the office.
Take care of Wheeler. Tonight.

564
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,685
Hey, look what I found.

565
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,189
We've got ourselves a groupie.

566
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,360
Heavily armed too.

567
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,864
- You know this guy?
- No.

568
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,034
You're not law enforcement.

569
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,869
Cartel finally grow some stones?

570
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,456
Who the hell are you?

571
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,669
Concerned third party? Ha, ha.

572
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,133
He's alone, that's what he is,
so he doesn't matter.

573
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,136
Take care of him.
And, uh, get rid of Wheeler tonight.

574
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,013
Make it look clean.

575
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:43,017
Hey, Stills. You screw this up,
I won't let it get to me.

576
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,687
I'll take care of you
just like I took care of Pope.

577
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,565
I can look after myself.
You know that.

578
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,552
- Nice spot.
- It's Oyster Bay.

579
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,971
Glad you like it.

580
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,056
You're gonna be here
a long, long time.

581
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,768
I'm curious...

582
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,230
...was there a point where you knew
you'd become a bad guy?

583
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,609
I got a mortgage to pay,
same as everybody else.

584
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,403
I woke up one day
and I realized I gotta guard...

585
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,072
...these assholes on Wall Street
robbing everybody.

586
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,242
Stealing more than my annual salary
in an afternoon.

587
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,078
So I said, what the hell?

588
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,041
I don't believe you.

589
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,960
See, I've been watching you, Lionel...

590
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:55,340
...and I think there's a big difference
between you and your friends.

591
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,216
Your heart's not really into it.

592
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,013
Stills, he does it for money. But I think
you do it because you're loyal.

593
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,807
What's the difference?

594
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,311
It's why I'm gonna let you live.

595
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,990
Yeah. I'm considering sticking
around New York for a while.

596
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,535
If I do, I'm gonna need someone
on the inside.

597
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,537
And you might come in handy.

598
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,916
- So I'm working for you now?
- That's right.

599
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,876
But I've got two rules.

600
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:36,923
One, you so much as hurt anybody,
and I'll kill you.

601
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,551
I don't particularly like killing people,
but I'm very good at it.

602
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,640
And two, you have to be more careful.

603
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,851
For instance, if you're gonna
put someone in your car...

604
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,479
...you have to search them properly.

605
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,399
What the...?

606
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,937
What are you doing?

607
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,824
You have your vest on, officer?

608
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,325
Yeah.

609
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,227
- Where the hell have...?
There's no time.

610
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,313
We were wrong.
Hansen isn't the target.

611
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,899
She's the ringleader.
They're going after Wheeler.

612
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,817
Tonight.

613
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,420
Yo, Wheeler's up there.

614
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,465
He heads to the gym most nights.
I got Doyle upstairs.

615
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,843
Place is a dump. There's no doorman,
no cameras, nobody.

616
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,722
We'll take him in the lobby. Soon
as it's done, we take the shooter out.

617
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,059
Give him a block, take him out.
Head shots this time, understand?

618
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,437
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get our friend out of the trunk.

619
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,275
- Who is this guy?
Some ex-con Wheeler put away.

620
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,370
Azarello, lights.

621
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,336
- Doyle, talk to me.
- He's coming out now.

622
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,551
Come on, Henry, let's go.

623
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,511
- Wait.
- Remember that basketball game...

624
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,347
...we're supposed to go to?
- He's got his kid with him.

625
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,849
What a waste.

626
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,184
Better watch out.

627
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,902
You're a very bad man, Charles.

628
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:49,740
You're about to kill a man.
And his son.

629
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,539
Please. Please don't do this.

630
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,084
Drop your weapon.

631
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,272
I think that's true, actually.

632
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,734
You keep working on it,
you'll be able to throw that fast.

633
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,485
- Really?
- Absolutely.

634
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,426
Let him go.

635
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,887
I can't do that.

636
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,139
I let him go,
my friends and I go to jail.

637
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:06,108
Drag your friend outside
and take him to the hospital. Right now.

638
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,866
I think I kill you and your friend here.

639
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,243
Make it look like you killed each other.

640
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,872
Then, just because
you pissed me off...

641
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:24,293
...I'm going to kill your family,
and all your friends.

642
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,340
I don't have any friends.
I don't have any family left, either.

643
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,176
Left them all behind.

644
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,513
Went around the world
looking for bad guys.

645
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,849
But there were plenty of you,
right here, all along.

646
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,078
So now, essentially,
you're telling us you couldn't see...

647
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,331
...what was happening
in the parking lot at all.

648
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,168
- I'm done, Your Honor.
Ms. Hansen?

649
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:10,381
The state isn't paying you by the hour,
counselor.

650
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,301
Why don't we have the defendant
tell you in her own words?

651
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,887
Let's listen to the 911 call she made.

652
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,184
And, hey, take care of Wheeler, tonight.

653
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:26,480
Make it look clean. Stills,
you screw this up, I won't let it get to me.

654
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,358
I'll take care of you
just like I took care of Pope.

655
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,403
I can look after myself. You know that.

656
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,928
You ready to get to work, officer?

657
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,515
I'm no good to you. I'm dead.

658
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,226
Just a matter of time
before the gangs get me.

659
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,480
- Or IA.
- No one knows you're involved.

660
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,981
I took care of that.

661
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,026
Besides, they'll be too busy
looking for Stills.

662
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,820
The police'll think he's run for it.

663
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,990
The gangs and the mob
will think he's gone Witness Protection.

664
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,160
- Is that where he is, Witness Protection?
- No, Lionel.

665
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,370
He's in the trunk.

666
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,166
I gave him a choice and he chose wrong.

667
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:33,631
Only problem is, uh,
well, I had to shoot him with your gun.

668
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,092
You'd have a hard time
explaining that one.

669
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,595
So, ha, ha,
you'll be taking another trip.

670
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,640
But I'm not coming along this time.

671
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,105
- Where am I going?
- Oyster Bay.

672
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:53,651
Where no one's gonna find him
for a long, long time.

673
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,319
I'll be in touch.

674
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,297
You have a decision to make.

675
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,467
The machine gave you
another number.

676
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,178
The numbers never stop coming.

677
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,806
You should know that up front.

678
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,975
Two questions.

679
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,852
First...

680
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,145
...why me?

681
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,941
I've been watching you
for a long time, John.

682
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,153
We have more in common
than you might think.

683
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,781
The world thinks we're both dead,
for starters.

684
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,911
You said two questions.

685
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,876
You programmed the machine
to delete those irrelevant numbers.

686
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,295
But now you're trying to save them.

687
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,172
What changed your mind?

688
00:52:56,882 --> 00:53:00,718
Let's just say you're not the only one
that's lost someone.

689
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,640
If you wanna leave, I'll give you
enough money to get as far as you need.

690
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,684
Disappear.

691
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,812
And if I stay?

692
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,316
They'll come looking for you.

693
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,153
The police, the mob,
your old friends at the CIA.

694
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,657
If you stay and we continue to do this...

695
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,829
...sooner or later,
both of us will probably wind up dead.

696
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,375
Actually dead, this time.

697
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,714
I said I'd tell you the truth.

698
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,343
I didn't say you'd like it.

699
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,354
Start talking, officer.
- You think I'm gonna rat on my friends?

700
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,190
Please, you can tell the DA
all about your crooked pals.

701
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,817
I wanna know about him,
the guy who came after you.

702
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,154
I don't know anything.
He was just some guy alone. In a suit.

703
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,157
You're gonna tell me everything
you don't know about him...

704
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,326
...and where I can find him.

705
00:54:08,305 --> 00:54:14,564
